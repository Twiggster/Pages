<p> Despite all the hosting sites being solid platforms, Csis Sever is the most secure for information. The permissions you need to get in are steep, and sometimes you cannot even access from off campus. Although, this feature may be a bug, it works in the individualâ€™s advantage to store files securely. It was a hard decision to make, hard enough where I would tie the remaining two hosting sites. Both offer convenience of access. The server also allows the user to create and maintain information on third party sites such as Notepad++.</p>
